# Terminal Flight Physics Simulator
A flight physics simulator in the terminal.<br>
Pretty bad right now, but I will improve later.<br>
It feels like I spent like a whole year of my life working on this but it was only like 10 hours.<br>
I will continue working on this but I will be taking a break for now.<br>
Feel free to make pull requests and experiment on my code.<br>
