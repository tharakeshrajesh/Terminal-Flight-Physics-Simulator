I should probably use ISO 8601 but I don't care so I just clarified ahead.<br />
First day, need to actually learn how this stuff works and will avoid AI.<br />
No AI. At all. Or I will try not to use AI. I swear I won't lie if I do.<br />
Okay, I have decided to use Pymunk as my physics engine becaues it's a popular choice.

I will admit that I used a very, very, small amount of AI.<br />
I spent 2 hours trying to get it to work so I just got mad
but the changes were only three lines so don't kill me pls.<br />
The changes from AI were lines 18 and 28.<br />
Also line 20 on the position (2nd) parameter.

But it works now so yay. I feel guilty though, I'm sorry guys.
